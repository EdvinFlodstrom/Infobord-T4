I continued working on learning web APIs in C#. I'm following a few different Microsoft tutorials on the subject, as listed below:
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-web-api-aspnet-core/3-exercise-create-web-api
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/beginners-series-to-web-apis/creating-a-web-api-project-3-of-18--beginners-series-to-web-apis
* https://learn.microsoft.com/sv-se/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-javascript?view=aspnetcore-8.0
* https://learn.microsoft.com/sv-se/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-8.0&preserve-view=true&tabs=visual-studio

I shall proceed in these courses/tutorials as well as watching related videos and reading articles to learn as much as possible.
