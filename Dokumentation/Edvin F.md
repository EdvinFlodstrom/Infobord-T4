I continued working on learning web APIs in C#. I'm following a few different Microsoft tutorials on the subject, as listed below:
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-web-api-aspnet-core/3-exercise-create-web-api
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/beginners-series-to-web-apis/creating-a-web-api-project-3-of-18--beginners-series-to-web-apis
* https://learn.microsoft.com/sv-se/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-javascript?view=aspnetcore-8.0
* https://learn.microsoft.com/sv-se/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-8.0&preserve-view=true&tabs=visual-studio

I shall proceed in these courses/tutorials as well as watching related videos and reading articles to learn as much as possible.

-----------------
I've continued to work with APIs in C#, and have made some progress. I went through this entire couse: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-web-api-aspnet-core/1-introduction, and have started with this course as well: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/persist-data-ef-core/4-interacting-data. The latter introduces subjects related to connecting a self-made API to databases that save content in a separate database rather than in-memory, which should be useful in the future. I had a little trouble with installing some packets through PowerShell, since the project requires the .NET version 7 framework rather than version 8, as is the most recent. When trying to install the packets, I got an error message saying that the packets were incompatible with the .NET version. Since the most recent version was automatically chosen, I was unintentionally trying to install packets of .NET version 8. With this link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-dotnet-cli, I found information about how to specify the version required, which got me the right packets. I'll continue with the course tomorrow, since it's proven rather insightful so far.
