I continued working on learning web APIs in C#. I'm following a few different Microsoft tutorials on the subject, as listed below:
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-web-api-aspnet-core/3-exercise-create-web-api
* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/beginners-series-to-web-apis/creating-a-web-api-project-3-of-18--beginners-series-to-web-apis
* https://learn.microsoft.com/sv-se/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-javascript?view=aspnetcore-8.0
* https://learn.microsoft.com/sv-se/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-8.0&preserve-view=true&tabs=visual-studio

I shall proceed in these courses/tutorials as well as watching related videos and reading articles to learn as much as possible.

-----------------
I've continued to work with APIs in C#, and have made some progress. I went through this entire couse: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-web-api-aspnet-core/1-introduction, and have started with this course as well: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/persist-data-ef-core/4-interacting-data. The latter introduces subjects related to connecting a self-made API to databases that save content in a separate database rather than in-memory, which should be useful in the future. I had a little trouble with installing some packets through PowerShell, since the project requires the .NET version 7 framework rather than version 8, as is the most recent. When trying to install the packets, I got an error message saying that the packets were incompatible with the .NET version. Since the most recent version was automatically chosen, I was unintentionally trying to install packets of .NET version 8. With this link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-dotnet-cli, I found information about how to specify the version required, which got me the right packets. I'll continue with the course tomorrow, since it's proven rather insightful so far.

After completing the tutorial I mentioned above, I continued with more of the same kind. I've started prioritizing tutorial projects related to Entity Framework Core, as it seems like a technology that could be very useful in this project. It allows me to connect a .NET API to an external database service, such as MongoDB. I went through this entire course today: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-web-api-minimal-database, and started on this one: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/secure-aspnet-core-identity/. However, the SQL database doesn't register changes made in the project. It seems that the problem has to do with an extension that the project requires, https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql.git. After downloading the extension, I can't seem to use its funcitons. When I attempted to connect to the SQL server, I got a message stating "command mssql.connect not found". I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the extension in two ways, while also reloading VSCodium. It had no effect, unfortunately, so I'll continue trying to fix it tomorrow.
