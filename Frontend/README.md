Since we intended to sell our product to molekylverkstaden from the beginning, we based our color scheme on the colors of their website.

After a short meeting we concluded that we wanted to compare two product and therefore we wanted a symmetrical website split in two with a descriptive paragraph, a picture of the products and some form of data. We quickly realized that we didn’t want to use plain numbers or regular diagrams for showing our data because we felt like the kids would think it’s boring and lose interest in it very fast. Instead, we decided to narrow our data down to just carbon dioxide emission and calories which we then visualized by a balloon (for CO2 emissions) and plate (for calories) SVG that vary in size based on the data.
