# Welcome to our project Infobord-T4 2023-2024!!!

## What is our project?
We are making a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that will be able to compare different foods and the amount of carbon dioxide they produce during production and shipping.

## How does it work?
You start by entering our website (it will also be downloadable on your phone), and are then presented with a welcoming page split in two. These two parts are mirrored representations of one another. They both contain a column filled with product name and information as well as an image of the product along with a balloon, which displays the carbon dioxide emissions by expanding or decreasing in size.

## How is our idea useful?
Our project compares different foods and displays the information in a way that makes it easy to tell the difference between the products. It is designed to be able to educate children on the topic of carbon dioxide emissions without it being difficult to comprehend. And, since our project will be accessible on a phone, almost everyone will be able to use it.

## How we picked our Frontend


## How we picked our Backend
Initially, our idea for a backend came from the words of our predecessors. They advised us to use C# as the language for "all that logic". So that's what we did, we built a web API with ASP.NET Core. However, we also wanted a cloud-based database, and so MongoDB was elected our database of choice. We also knew the API required some security features, all the code is public on GitHub after all. And just like that, our goal was set and our backend was underway.

With all this clear, all that was left to do was build the API. We used VSCodium as our code editor, Postman as our tool for testing the API, and MongoDB as our cloud-based database. The longest process was learning how to build an API, but by following tutorials and asking ~~ChatGPT~~ our teachers for tips and tricks, we learned all that was necessary. Building the actual API didn't take long, and it worked well for our purposes. It was a captivating and insightful process that brought light to some new concepts and ideas.
