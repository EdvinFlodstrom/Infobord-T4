# Welcome to our project Infobord-T4 2023-2024!!!

## What is our project?
We are making a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which will be able to compare different foods and the ammount of carbon dioxide it produses during production and shipping of the product. 
## How does it work?
You enter our website (which will also be downloadable on your phone). Once you have entered you will be presented with a welcoming page split into two. These two parts are mirrored representations of eachother. They both contain a column filled with product name and information as well as an image of the product and a balloon which displays the carbon dioxide emissions through expanding or decreasing in size.
## How is our idea useful?
Our project compares different foods and displays it in a way that makes it simple to tell de difference between the products. It is designed to be able to educate children on the topic of carbon dioxide emissions without it being hart to take in. And since it will be accessible on a phone almost everyone will be able to use it.
